","Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X and 6. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]",2.64,0.97,0.37,-1.67,"patient1_healthy",22.32,"healthy ASCs"

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient1_healthy",9.28,"healthy ASCs"

","Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the muscle-type isozyme.

","This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the integrin superfamily. Members of this family are adhesion receptors that function in signaling from the extracellular matrix to the cell. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. The encoded protein forms dimers with an alpha4 chain or an alphaE chain and plays a role in leukocyte adhesion. Dimerization with alpha4 forms a homing receptor for migration of lymphocytes to the intestinal mucosa and Peyer's patches. Dimerization with alphaE permits binding to the ligand epithelial cadherin, a calcium-dependent adhesion molecule. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient1_healthy",7.7,"healthy ASCs"

Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function. Mutations in this gene have been associated with nonsyndromic deafness. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2017]",0.6,0.24,0.4,-0.36,"patient2_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient2_healthy",6.55,"healthy ASCs"

","Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the muscle-type isozyme. Mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease.

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient2_healthy",2.82,"healthy ASCs"

PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene encodes a member of a homeobox transcription factor gene family similiar to the Drosophila distal-less gene. The encoded protein is localized to the nucleus where it may function as a transcriptional regulator of signals from multiple TGF-{beta} superfamily members. The encoded protein may play a role in the control of craniofacial patterning and the differentiation and survival of inhibitory neurons in the forebrain. This gene is located in a tail-to-tail configuration with another member of the family on the long arm of chromosome 2.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function. Mutations in this gene have been associated with nonsyndromic deafness. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2017]",0.6,0.24,0.4,-0.36,"patient3_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient3_healthy",2.77,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene encodes a member of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that participate in cell cycle regulation. The encoded protein is the catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase complex, which regulates progression through the cell cycle. Activity of this protein is especially critical during the G1 to S phase transition. This protein associates with and regulated by other subunits of the complex including cyclin A or E, CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 (CDKN1A), and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B).

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient3_healthy",0.73,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene is a member of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family, and is predicted to contain an N-terminal pyrin effector domain (PYD), a centrally-located nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR). Members of this gene family are thought to be important regulators of immune responses. This gene product interacts with components of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, and can regulate both caspase-1 and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity. The pyrin domain is necessary and sufficient for suppression of NF-kB activity. An allelic variant (rs147585490) has been found that is incapable of blocking the transcriptional activity of NF-kB. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]",0.26,0.11,0.44,-0.14,"patient3_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene is a member of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family, and is predicted to contain an N-terminal pyrin effector domain (PYD), a centrally-located nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR). Members of this gene family are thought to be important regulators of immune responses. This gene product interacts with components of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, and can regulate both caspase-1 and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity. The pyrin domain is necessary and sufficient for suppression of NF-kB activity. An allelic variant (rs147585490) has been found that is incapable of blocking the transcriptional activity of NF-kB. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]",0.37,0.16,0.44,-0.21,"patient3_healthy",0.22,"healthy ASCs"

","Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X and 6. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]",2.64,0.97,0.37,-1.67,"patient4_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient4_healthy",4.56,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient4_healthy",9.08,"healthy ASCs"

","The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane protein that catalyzes the addition of an alkyl group from an akylamine to a glutamine residue of a protein, forming an alkylglutamine in the protein.

PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X and 6. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]",2.64,0.97,0.37,-1.67,"patient5_healthy",0.5,"healthy ASCs"

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient5_healthy",2.69,"healthy ASCs"

","Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the muscle-type isozyme.

","This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the integrin superfamily. Members of this family are adhesion receptors that function in signaling from the extracellular matrix to the cell. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. The encoded protein forms dimers with an alpha4 chain or an alphaE chain and plays a role in leukocyte adhesion. Dimerization with alpha4 forms a homing receptor for migration of lymphocytes to the intestinal mucosa and Peyer's patches. Dimerization with alphaE permits binding to the ligand epithelial cadherin, a calcium-dependent adhesion molecule. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient5_healthy",0.3,"healthy ASCs"

Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function. Mutations in this gene have been associated with nonsyndromic deafness. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2017]",0.6,0.24,0.4,-0.36,"patient6_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient6_healthy",10.86,"healthy ASCs"

","Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the muscle-type isozyme. Mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease.

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient6_healthy",5.32,"healthy ASCs"

PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene encodes a member of a homeobox transcription factor gene family similiar to the Drosophila distal-less gene. The encoded protein is localized to the nucleus where it may function as a transcriptional regulator of signals from multiple TGF-{beta} superfamily members. The encoded protein may play a role in the control of craniofacial patterning and the differentiation and survival of inhibitory neurons in the forebrain. This gene is located in a tail-to-tail configuration with another member of the family on the long arm of chromosome 2.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function. Mutations in this gene have been associated with nonsyndromic deafness. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2017]",0.6,0.24,0.4,-0.36,"patient7_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient7_healthy",3.62,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene encodes a member of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that participate in cell cycle regulation. The encoded protein is the catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase complex, which regulates progression through the cell cycle. Activity of this protein is especially critical during the G1 to S phase transition. This protein associates with and regulated by other subunits of the complex including cyclin A or E, CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 (CDKN1A), and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B).

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient7_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene is a member of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family, and is predicted to contain an N-terminal pyrin effector domain (PYD), a centrally-located nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR). Members of this gene family are thought to be important regulators of immune responses. This gene product interacts with components of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, and can regulate both caspase-1 and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity. The pyrin domain is necessary and sufficient for suppression of NF-kB activity. An allelic variant (rs147585490) has been found that is incapable of blocking the transcriptional activity of NF-kB. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]",0.26,0.11,0.44,-0.14,"patient7_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene is a member of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family, and is predicted to contain an N-terminal pyrin effector domain (PYD), a centrally-located nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR). Members of this gene family are thought to be important regulators of immune responses. This gene product interacts with components of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, and can regulate both caspase-1 and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity. The pyrin domain is necessary and sufficient for suppression of NF-kB activity. An allelic variant (rs147585490) has been found that is incapable of blocking the transcriptional activity of NF-kB. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]",0.37,0.16,0.44,-0.21,"patient7_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X and 6. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]",2.64,0.97,0.37,-1.67,"patient8_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient8_healthy",3.08,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient8_healthy",1.89,"healthy ASCs"

","The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane protein that catalyzes the addition of an alkyl group from an akylamine to a glutamine residue of a protein, forming an alkylglutamine in the protein.

PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X and 6. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]",2.64,0.97,0.37,-1.67,"patient9_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient9_healthy",8.29,"healthy ASCs"

","Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the muscle-type isozyme.

","This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the integrin superfamily. Members of this family are adhesion receptors that function in signaling from the extracellular matrix to the cell. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. The encoded protein forms dimers with an alpha4 chain or an alphaE chain and plays a role in leukocyte adhesion. Dimerization with alpha4 forms a homing receptor for migration of lymphocytes to the intestinal mucosa and Peyer's patches. Dimerization with alphaE permits binding to the ligand epithelial cadherin, a calcium-dependent adhesion molecule. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient9_healthy",1.03,"healthy ASCs"

Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function. Mutations in this gene have been associated with nonsyndromic deafness. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2017]",0.6,0.24,0.4,-0.36,"patient10_healthy",0,"healthy ASCs"

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC.

Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase.

","Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the muscle-type isozyme.

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient10_healthy",8.43,"healthy ASCs"

","Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","The protein encoded by this gene shares similarity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad52, a protein important for DNA double-strand break repair and homologous recombination. This gene product was shown to bind single-stranded DNA ends, and mediate the DNA-DNA interaction necessary for the annealing of complementary DNA strands. It was also found to interact with DNA recombination protein RAD51, which suggested its role in RAD51 related DNA recombination and repair. A pseudogene of this gene is present on chromosome 2. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient1_diseased",5.84,"diseased ASCs"

","This gene encodes a member of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that participate in cell cycle regulation. The encoded protein is the catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase complex, which regulates progression through the cell cycle. Activity of this protein is especially critical during the G1 to S phase transition. This protein associates with and regulated by other subunits of the complex including cyclin A or E, CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 (CDKN1A), and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B).

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient1_diseased",0.81,"diseased ASCs"

","This gene is a member of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family, and is predicted to contain an N-terminal pyrin effector domain (PYD), a centrally-located nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR). Members of this gene family are thought to be important regulators of immune responses. This gene product interacts with components of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, and can regulate both caspase-1 and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity. The pyrin domain is necessary and sufficient for suppression of NF-kB activity. An allelic variant (rs147585490) has been found that is incapable of blocking the transcriptional activity of NF-kB.

","Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes a nuclear-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase. The encoded protein can promote tumor formation by targeting tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53, for proteasomal degradation. This gene is itself transcriptionally-regulated by p53. Overexpression or amplification of this locus is detected in a variety of different cancers. There is a pseudogene for this gene on chromosome 2. Alternative splicing results in a multitude of transcript variants, many of which may be expressed only in tumor cells.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X and 6. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]",2.64,0.97,0.37,-1.67,"patient2_diseased",0,"diseased ASCs"

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient2_diseased",3.18,"diseased ASCs"

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient2_diseased",1.21,"diseased ASCs"

PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function. Mutations in this gene have been associated with nonsyndromic deafness. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2017]",0.6,0.24,0.4,-0.36,"patient3_diseased",0.94,"diseased ASCs"

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient3_diseased",4.05,"diseased ASCs"

","Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the muscle-type isozyme. Mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease.

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient3_diseased",0.56,"diseased ASCs"

","Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","The protein encoded by this gene shares similarity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad52, a protein important for DNA double-strand break repair and homologous recombination. This gene product was shown to bind single-stranded DNA ends, and mediate the DNA-DNA interaction necessary for the annealing of complementary DNA strands. It was also found to interact with DNA recombination protein RAD51, which suggested its role in RAD51 related DNA recombination and repair. A pseudogene of this gene is present on chromosome 2. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient4_diseased",2.53,"diseased ASCs"

","This gene encodes a member of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that participate in cell cycle regulation. The encoded protein is the catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase complex, which regulates progression through the cell cycle. Activity of this protein is especially critical during the G1 to S phase transition. This protein associates with and regulated by other subunits of the complex including cyclin A or E, CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 (CDKN1A), and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B).

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes.

","This gene is a member of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family, and is predicted to contain an N-terminal pyrin effector domain (PYD), a centrally-located nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR). Members of this gene family are thought to be important regulators of immune responses. This gene product interacts with components of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, and can regulate both caspase-1 and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity. The pyrin domain is necessary and sufficient for suppression of NF-kB activity. An allelic variant (rs147585490) has been found that is incapable of blocking the transcriptional activity of NF-kB.

","Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes a nuclear-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase. The encoded protein can promote tumor formation by targeting tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53, for proteasomal degradation. This gene is itself transcriptionally-regulated by p53. Overexpression or amplification of this locus is detected in a variety of different cancers. There is a pseudogene for this gene on chromosome 2. Alternative splicing results in a multitude of transcript variants, many of which may be expressed only in tumor cells.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X and 6. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]",2.64,0.97,0.37,-1.67,"patient5_diseased",0.27,"diseased ASCs"

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient5_diseased",0,"diseased ASCs"

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient5_diseased",0.89,"diseased ASCs"

PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function. Mutations in this gene have been associated with nonsyndromic deafness. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2017]",0.6,0.24,0.4,-0.36,"patient6_diseased",0,"diseased ASCs"

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient6_diseased",7.18,"diseased ASCs"

","Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the muscle-type isozyme.

","This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the integrin superfamily. Members of this family are adhesion receptors that function in signaling from the extracellular matrix to the cell. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. The encoded protein forms dimers with an alpha4 chain or an alphaE chain and plays a role in leukocyte adhesion. Dimerization with alpha4 forms a homing receptor for migration of lymphocytes to the intestinal mucosa and Peyer's patches. Dimerization with alphaE permits binding to the ligand epithelial cadherin, a calcium-dependent adhesion molecule. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient6_diseased",3.01,"diseased ASCs"

","Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","The protein encoded by this gene shares similarity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad52, a protein important for DNA double-strand break repair and homologous recombination. This gene product was shown to bind single-stranded DNA ends, and mediate the DNA-DNA interaction necessary for the annealing of complementary DNA strands. It was also found to interact with DNA recombination protein RAD51, which suggested its role in RAD51 related DNA recombination and repair. A pseudogene of this gene is present on chromosome 2. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient7_diseased",0,"diseased ASCs"

","This gene encodes a member of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that participate in cell cycle regulation. The encoded protein is the catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase complex, which regulates progression through the cell cycle. Activity of this protein is especially critical during the G1 to S phase transition. This protein associates with and regulated by other subunits of the complex including cyclin A or E, CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 (CDKN1A), and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B).

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes.

","This gene is a member of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family, and is predicted to contain an N-terminal pyrin effector domain (PYD), a centrally-located nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR). Members of this gene family are thought to be important regulators of immune responses. This gene product interacts with components of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, and can regulate both caspase-1 and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity. The pyrin domain is necessary and sufficient for suppression of NF-kB activity. An allelic variant (rs147585490) has been found that is incapable of blocking the transcriptional activity of NF-kB.

","Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes a nuclear-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase. The encoded protein can promote tumor formation by targeting tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53, for proteasomal degradation. This gene is itself transcriptionally-regulated by p53. Overexpression or amplification of this locus is detected in a variety of different cancers. There is a pseudogene for this gene on chromosome 2. Alternative splicing results in a multitude of transcript variants, many of which may be expressed only in tumor cells.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes X and 6. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]",2.64,0.97,0.37,-1.67,"patient8_diseased",0.49,"diseased ASCs"

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient8_diseased",0.56,"diseased ASCs"

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient8_diseased",0.55,"diseased ASCs"

PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function. Mutations in this gene have been associated with nonsyndromic deafness. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2017]",0.6,0.24,0.4,-0.36,"patient9_diseased",0,"diseased ASCs"

","This gene encodes a nuclear receptor that may be a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The encoded protein localizes to the nuclear membrane and has been implicated in the nuclear trafficking of the transcription repressors REST/NRSF and REST4. Mutations in this gene have been linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 3.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient9_diseased",0,"diseased ASCs"

","Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the muscle-type isozyme. Mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease.

","The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-protein family that recognizes the consensus binding site (E-box) CANNTG. This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient9_diseased",0,"diseased ASCs"

","Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. It is a calcium-independent and phospholipids-dependent protein kinase. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been shown to reside specifically in the cell nucleus. This protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation by activating the MAP kinase MAPK13 (p38delta)-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). It is also found to mediate the transcription activation of the transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction.

","The protein encoded by this gene shares similarity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad52, a protein important for DNA double-strand break repair and homologous recombination. This gene product was shown to bind single-stranded DNA ends, and mediate the DNA-DNA interaction necessary for the annealing of complementary DNA strands. It was also found to interact with DNA recombination protein RAD51, which suggested its role in RAD51 related DNA recombination and repair. A pseudogene of this gene is present on chromosome 2. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.

","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

","This gene encodes one subunit of a trimeric complex forming a highly conserved transcription factor that binds with high specificity to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of a variety of genes. The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

","This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Two main isozymes are known to exist in eukaryotic cells: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. This gene encodes the cytosolic isozyme, which plays a key role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is localized in the peroxisomes.

","Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, which is also called the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, is one of the subunits of myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]",5.74,2.33,0.41,-3.41,"patient10_diseased",0,"diseased ASCs"

","This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children. The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes. The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]",3.21,1.25,0.39,-1.96,"patient10_diseased",2,"diseased ASCs"
