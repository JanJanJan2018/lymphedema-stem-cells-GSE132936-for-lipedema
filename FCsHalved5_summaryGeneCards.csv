The encoded protein is localized to the nucleus where it may function as a transcriptional regulator of signals from multiple TGF-{beta} superfamily members. The encoded protein may play a role in the control of craniofacial patterning and the differentiation and survival of inhibitory neurons in the forebrain. This gene is located in a tail-to-tail configuration with another member of the family on the long arm of chromosome 2.

"ENST00000412777","LRTOMT","ENSG00000184154","This gene has evolved in primates as a fusion of two ancestral neighboring genes, Lrrc51 and Tomt, which exist as two independent genes in rodents. The fusion gene contains some shared exons, but encodes structurally unrelated proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Those variants that utilize the more centromere-proximal 3' terminal exon (short transcript form) encode LRTOMT1, while those variants that use a more centromere-distal 3' terminal exon (long transcript form) encode the LRTOMT2 protein. There is a small region within one of the exons of this gene that contains overlapping alternate reading frames for both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT1 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Lrrc51, while LRTOMT2 shares similarity with the protein encoded by mouse Tomt. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, encoding different isoforms of both LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. The LRTOMT1 protein is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, while the LRTOMT2 protein is a catechol-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to a hydroxyl group of catechols and is essential for auditory and vestibular function.

The encoded protein, subunit C, forms a tight dimer with the B subunit, a prerequisite for subunit A association. The resulting trimer binds to DNA with high specificity and affinity. Subunits B and C each contain a histone-like motif. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Myosin phosphatase regulates the interaction of actin and myosin downstream of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP. RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Dimerization with alpha4 forms a homing receptor for migration of lymphocytes to the intestinal mucosa and Peyer's patches. Dimerization with alphaE permits binding to the ligand epithelial cadherin, a calcium-dependent adhesion molecule. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.
